** What are you grateful for?
My will to try it out still, to not completely give it all even if it's the easiest choice for me to make.
** What do you want today's highlight to be?
It already happened! I went for a jog, it was great, I got back and took a cold shower! I guess what I want is to keep up the pace.
** What's on your mind?
MAN it makes a difference waking up early, exercising and getting home for a cold shower... I feel refreshed, just wish my new table would get here today. üôÅ
