* Morning Journal
** What are you grateful for?
My strategical thinking.
** What do you want today's highlight to be?
I wanna sleep early and feel accomplished in some sense.
** What's on your mind?
I played a ranked match of DOTA 2 and I was fully in the strategical mindset, taking advantage of my sharp perception of people's emotions; I've realized that this mindset of trying to analyze and put things in perspective is my preferred way to be and think.
