* Evening Reflection
** How are you feeling today?
Mild at best. Things did not go exactly as I had planned, I ended up sleeping a good portion of the day, wasn't productive but things aligned in a way that I didn't need to either way.

At the very least at night I played an interesting RTS with Zak and Guild Wars 2 with Jessica with she enjoyed quite a bit.
** What could you have done better?
Slept properly, writing this at 00:50 for example which I should write much earlier.
** Amazing things that happened
Jessica loved our Guild Wars 2 experience today!
** What did you learn today?
That Jessica still likes Guild Wars 2 ðŸ’•.
