** What are you grateful for?
The opportunities I've had so far in my life.
** What do you want today's highlight to be?
To finish the day with a sense of accomplishment.
** What's on your mind?
I feel like I'm starting to understand where to aim and move forward with my life, but it won't be something that will change in a day's work - soon enough however I should feel comfortable with it.
