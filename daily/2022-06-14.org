* Morning Journal
** What are you grateful for?
Today? I am unsure honestly, but I'm always grateful for the knowledge I posses, so that's something to always look forward to.
** What do you want the today's highlight to be?
I just wanna sleep early and wake up early, simple as that, nothing complicated.
** What's on your mind?
Since I'm writing this while at work, I'll keep it extremely short: My mind is full of doubts, as per usual, I need to meditate today.
