* Morning Journal
** What are you grateful for?
My job, it's... What I needed honestly, it's going slow for now but once it picks up the pace I know it'll be amazing.
** What do you want today's highlight to be?
Nothing really, I'm already happy with my day, maybe just work a little on [[id:8b605e4e-f9e7-4f03-bf4e-8058976aaeae][Akita Neru]].
** What's on your mind?
I feel a little less sick, hopefully I'll slowly increase the pace of my life again, get a little less lazy.
