* Morning Journal
** What are you grateful for?
To have been born and gone through the things I did, they were awful to go through but it made me the person I am today.
** What do you want today's highlight to be?
It is time to be productive! Even if not for long, I want to code a little today or at least do some research.
** What's on your mind?
I feel so free, oddly enough. Something triggered on me yesterday and I feel like myself once more, maybe I was in an episode of depression that lasted way too long or maybe I was basically constantly on that condition where you handle things with a /automatic/ responses, as if I was not there - which certainly sounds more compelling.
