* Evening Reflection
** How are you feeling today?
Really tired.
** What could you have done better?
Slept earlier, I would have avoided a really unproductive day, but also, focused on what was truly essential.
** Amazing things that happened
I've realised a stupid mistake I've made for a while.
** What did you learn today?
Still on about that stupid mistake, I've re-learned, or rather, realised again that functionality is the top priority. I can't make a shape without a core. Will make a note specifically about this.
