** How are you feeling today?
Pretty good, I was quite productive while pair programming with Lucas. Slowly getting back in my feet, I hope that soon I will be studying and working in my personal projects again.
** What could you have done better?
Woke up earlier for sure, other than that, nothing really. At least considering the current circumstances.
** Amazing things that happened
I have done some pair programming with Lucas and it has been immensely productive, it will help me get back in track by quite a bit.
** What did you learn today?
Just got reminded of how fortunate I am.
