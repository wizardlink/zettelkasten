* Morning Journal
** What are you grateful for?
My perception and quick thinking, I am really grateful of that.
** What do you want today's highlight to be?
I want to work on /Akita Neru/, the framework for our new Discord applications that are incoming.
** What's on your mind?
Man... I rock; It's hard to accept this, my ego will not allow it, I still have it stuck in the back of my mind people saying that my ego was too inflated, but it truly wasn't. I am an amazing individual and have to recognise that.
