#+title: 497151 - Create the cloud render backgrounds list
#+filetags: :work:cyncly:
* Overview
I have to implement the UI containing the list of backgrounds and lay the foundation to be able to "activate" them giving focus on the card that's in use.

* What is missing
** DONE A way to activate a card [4/4]
*** [X] The CSS for activated cards.
*** [X] Parent-level state management for the cards that are activated.
*** [X] Callback to receive get the selected card from the list.
*** KILL Be able to save the information in the database.
** DONE Test it
/Depends on the ~IS7.Services~ blocker that I have currently./
*** [X] It looks like in the prototype.
*** [X] You can choose what card is active.
*** KILL The data of what card was picked is sent to the generation process.
