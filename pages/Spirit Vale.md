				- Spawns a medium-sized <span style="color: #33cc00;">green AoE circles</span> that **closes in 5 seconds** and deals <u>80% maximum health as damage</u>. This orb **spawns every 15 seconds**.
				  id:: 65590f58-8011-40b7-9981-596256b36703
				- If four players who are not downed <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/0/0a/Downed_ally_overhead_icon.png" style="height: 25px;" /> are inside the circle, it will not do damage.
				  id:: 65590f58-8f52-4c23-ad51-5c0cbbfac611
				- This can generally just be ignored, once triggered you can burst heal the affected players.
				  id:: 65590f58-8a47-4e4d-b7f6-56eccb026c63
			- **Blue Pylon Power** <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/6/6e/Blue_Pylon_Power.png" style="width: 30px;" />
			  id:: 6558f643-8cac-45b7-9d3a-6e29bb1a3fc7

				  id:: 65590f58-f2cc-438a-aee7-c879ebd549a6
		- ### Red Guardian <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/b/b8/Red_Guardian_portrait.png" style="width: 30px;" />
		  id:: 6558f6fd-129a-4095-a974-a78994f970d3
			- This guardian has very high toughness <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/1/12/Toughness.png" style="width: 15px;" /> making it very hard to kill, thus **needing condition damage** <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/5/54/Condition_Damage.png" style="width: 15px;" /> to deal with it.
			- **Seeker** <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/5/5e/Seeker_portrait.png" style="width: 30px;" />
			  id:: 6558f7af-4ba3-4508-bbc5-ba03c2312f1f
				- Seekers are <span style="color: #cc0000;">red AoE circles</span> that **spawn every 15 seconds** and **last for 20 seconds**, a player has to focus on controlling these and pulling them away from the group, knockback <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/c/ca/Knockback.png" style="width: 15px;" />, immobilize <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/3/32/Immobile.png" style="width: 15px;"/>, chill <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/a/a6/Chilled.png" style="width: 15px;" />, cripple <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/f/fb/Crippled.png" style="width: 15px;" /> and fear <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/e/e6/Fear.png" style="width: 15px;" /> work on seekers.
	- ## Phase one (100% to 66%)
	  id:: 65590f58-1a56-4f33-866e-58f600ee8af8
		- The ((6558f21b-f035-4478-8b5d-1b227f73ac8b)) stands in the center of a circular arena which is split into three sections, each section has a **pylon with a color** on it, these **represent each guardian** from the pre-event.
		  id:: 65590f58-605c-4049-9362-d9303177dbfd
		- This encounter is a combination of all the pre-event mechanics with some slight changes:
			- Three ((6558f7af-4ba3-4508-bbc5-ba03c2312f1f)) spawn every 20 seconds and last 20 seconds.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- ((6558f504-40f1-4632-b14e-c5d464c25fea)) triggers every 15 seconds.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The ((6558f21b-f035-4478-8b5d-1b227f73ac8b)) focuses on whoever has the highest toughness, thus the <span style="color: #ddbd3b;">tank</span> has to aggro the boss into the south-east edge of the arena on the line that splits the sections. This lets you dodge <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/3/34/Dodge_Instructor_%28map_icon%29.png" style="width: 15px;" /> backwards into the wall. The <span style="color: #ddbd3b;">tank</span> **has to face the boss away from the group**.
		  id:: 65590f58-1198-4320-a7eb-1f04c76c100c
		- Once the boss reaches 66% it goes invulnerable and returns to the center of the arena, **make sure there are no ((6558f504-40f1-4632-b14e-c5d464c25fea)) as it phases, if so, stack on your healer.
	- ## Split Phase
	  id:: 65590f58-e323-4a24-87bc-f5e30cbf68a3
		- During this phase the ((6558f21b-f035-4478-8b5d-1b227f73ac8b)) **splits into the three coloured guardians**, here we split into two groups:
		  id:: 65590f58-7615-4b3b-884a-73ce7d0ecd04
			- Condition damage players to the ((6558f6fd-129a-4095-a974-a78994f970d3))
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  id:: 65590f58-1009-45bd-b0da-274817afe0f9
			- Rest of the players to the ((6558f4e0-6ab6-46df-88a9-4d03b483cb7b)) with a single player pulling the ((6558f2d2-ad0a-4642-94c4-cebe1564407e)) over to the ((6558f4e0-6ab6-46df-88a9-4d03b483cb7b)).
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  id:: 65590f58-c585-4648-9a68-af3e51929a22
		- The arena is split into three sections, the section that you stand in gives you an attunement to the corresponding guardian, being in the presence of another guardian outside of their section does significant amounts of damage.
		- Players fighting the ((6558f4e0-6ab6-46df-88a9-4d03b483cb7b)) will take significant damage from the ((6558f2d2-ad0a-4642-94c4-cebe1564407e)) aura once it's been brought over, however the healers will be with them thus outhealing the damage.
		- All players fighting the ((6558f4e0-6ab6-46df-88a9-4d03b483cb7b)) should move over the ((6558f504-40f1-4632-b14e-c5d464c25fea)) as well to prevent players fighting the ((6558f6fd-129a-4095-a974-a78994f970d3)) from getting downed <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/0/0a/Downed_ally_overhead_icon.png" style="height: 25px;" />.
	- ## Phase two (66% to 33%)
	  id:: 65591043-e376-4fc2-8a08-6c791079d81f
		- Once all the guardians have been vanquished the ((6558f21b-f035-4478-8b5d-1b227f73ac8b)) will re-appear in the center of the arena, this phase works just like ((65590f58-1a56-4f33-866e-58f600ee8af8)) but with two extra mechanics:
		  id:: 65591057-e0cb-4d42-b02a-dfa1f9767c58
			- A section of the arena glows with a damage tick rotating clockwise causing ~2000 damage, avoiding ((65590f58-c086-422c-bb2f-8c60657f5bc1)) is very important during this.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  id:: 65591093-90f8-40d5-919a-ede686ee9e89
			- Magic Storm <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/5/5f/Monster_Skill.png" style="width: 30px;" /> now appears, which causes orbs to fly out and damage in red AoEs where the orbs land. We can stop this mechanic by breaking the guardian's breakbar <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/4/49/Unshakable2.png/20px-Unshakable2.png" style="width: 15px;" />.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  id:: 655910a0-8e52-4e71-a3a0-f2df43c2ab96
		- The <span style="color: #ddbd3b;">tank</span> will be on the dividing line in the south-east platform between blue and red. Stand on the red side and move to blue once the red ground starts glowing. You only need to move a few steps to
		   either side of the line when the floor changes.
		- Once the guardian's health reaches 33% the ((65590f58-e323-4a24-87bc-f5e30cbf68a3)) begins again. The <span style="color: #ddbd3b;">tank</span> will move to the dividing line between red and green. The glowing sections change quickly so the tank needs to move Vale Guardian quickly. As soon as the glowing section changes, immediately move clockwise to the edge of the next section.
	- ## Phase three (33% to 0%)
		- This phase is similar to ((65590f58-1a56-4f33-866e-58f600ee8af8)) and ((65591043-e376-4fc2-8a08-6c791079d81f)) with a few changes:
			- Two out of the three floor sections now glow, beginning with green and blue, these sections rotate every 15 seconds instead of 20.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Four ((6558f7af-4ba3-4508-bbc5-ba03c2312f1f)) now spawn, with the fourth spawning in the very center of the arena.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- ((65590f58-c086-422c-bb2f-8c60657f5bc1)) spawns on all squad members.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The magic storm mentioned in ((65591043-e376-4fc2-8a08-6c791079d81f)) makes so the ((6558f21b-f035-4478-8b5d-1b227f73ac8b)) does not moves, his breakbar <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/4/49/Unshakable2.png/20px-Unshakable2.png" style="width: 15px;" /> must be broken as soon as possible.
		  id:: 65591212-5113-4146-a289-2fdc8f177fa7
		- When ((6558f504-40f1-4632-b14e-c5d464c25fea)) is nearby, stand in with the group inside of it to mitigate damage, but be aware that ((65590f58-c086-422c-bb2f-8c60657f5bc1)) spawns on all members, so mitigation might fail if not dodged or walked away from.
- # Spirit Woods <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/8/81/Portal_Entre.png" style="width: 30px;" />
	- ## Requirements
		- Glider Basics mastery <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/3/36/Glider_Basics.png" style="width: 30px;" />
		- Condition-cleansing, aegis <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/e/e5/Aegis.png" style="width: 15px;" />, stability <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/a/ae/Stability.png" style="width: 15px;" /> to handle knockback <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/c/ca/Knockback.png" style="width: 15px;" /> and cripple <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/f/fb/Crippled.png" style="width: 15px;" />.
		- (OPTIONAL) class capable of using portals to ease on the first mini-event.
	- ## Event 1: Closing Rifts
	  collapsed:: true
		- After killing ((6558f21b-f035-4478-8b5d-1b227f73ac8b)), go north and follow the tunnel clearing enemies until you come to the ledge, wait there for the group so you don't trigger the fight.
		- This event requires us to close explosive rifts before the time runs out, a total of **20 rifts** within four minutes need to be closed for the gate to be opened.
		- Within the arena there are adrenal mushrooms <img src="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/1/1c/Adrenal_Mushrooms.png" style="width: 15px;" /> to reset your cooldowns, perfect for portal makers to bring everyone between portals.
		- ### Rift locations
		  collapsed:: true
			- <img src="https://assets.snowcrows.com/uploads/2821db7c-a151-11ec-8fcf-ca7a943c517e/Zl1BlaxV7j0cc2NXknmCsgjJjoC23IyQzhF7PS2W.webp" style="width: 600px;" />
		- ### Event start
			- When all the enemies in the arena are killed the event will start, more enemies will spawn and red rings with orbs will appear around the arena.
			- Once the orbs are spawned the group must stack on them to **turn the rings blue** until they disappear or we'll wipe.
			- As time passes, rifts start spawning more quickly so we **close older rifts first**.
			- **The more players in a rift, the faster it closes.**
	- ## Event 2: Escaping the Spirits
		- After going through the opened gate, we stack behind the far left pillar and kill all enemies, once they are dead the gate for the second event opens. Go through it and wait on the platform as once we're down, the event starts.
