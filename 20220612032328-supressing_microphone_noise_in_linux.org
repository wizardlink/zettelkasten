#+title: Supressing microphone noise in Linux
#+filetags: :linux:tool:
I used this plugin for PipeWire called "noise-supression-for-voice", it's both available in Linux and Windows but I am mainly looking for it in Linux. It applies RNNoise in real time by creating a sink to pass the microphone through, it's documentation can be found in it's [[https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice][GitHub README]].

The plugin is stored in ~$HOME/Documents/builds/noise-supression-for-voice~.
