** Problems
*** [[https://dev.azure.com/2020Development/IS7/_workitems/edit/594690][594690]]
When adding a cabinet in the corner, adding a door then moving it out of the corner and back, we get two notifications instead of one. This bug was specific to a problem where when the user moved the cabinet at all it would trigger a new message, but there are edge cases like these still.
* Design rules
** /addProduct/
*** Items [0/2]

*** Problems
**** ~cabinetTooTallCheckRoomHeight~
The notification shown has a mustache tag that was not handled.

This is not being triggered, the rule exists for ~addProduct~ and ~addAccessory~, with only the latter working.
