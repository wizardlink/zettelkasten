#+title: Sway issue with specific input device ID
#+filetags: :issue:

* The issue
So, I have a KVM switch plugged to two computers in which at the click of a button I can swap which computer has access to those devices connected to the switch. In SwayWM I was having this weird issue where my logitech mouse was causing SwayWM to literally crash whenever I gave my main computer access to my device; I fixed this however by using ~input "type:pointer" {}~ instead of directly using the device ID.
** KILL The report
I gotta open an issue in the [[github:swaywm/sway][repository of SwayWM]] to track this and have it figured out.
